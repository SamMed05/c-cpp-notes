## Definition

A function is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.

In more general terms, a function is a system which takes an input and returns it as output 
after doing some calculations inside to perform a specific task.

<figcaption>Fig.1. Abstract representation of a system.</figcaption>

If you have a mathematical background, you may be led to associate the functioning 
of mathematical functions with that of programming functions. Although this association is 
partly correct (inputs â†’ calculations â†’ output), it is confusing to consider them the same thing so we will keep them 
as separate concepts.

We have already used functions: `main()` is a special function that every executable 
program must have, and it was present in every one of our programs done so far.
Also writing `<iostream>` means having to deal with functions (inside that library):
although it doesn't look like it, every time you `<<` or `>>` operator to do 
input or output, you're using a function provided by the standard library.

The [C++ standard library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header) comes with plenty 
of already-written functions ready to use. But this doesn't mean that we can't write ours! 
Functions that you write yourself are called ***user-defined functions***.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function as inputs, but it is not always 
necessary.

## Why use functions

There are two benefits that come when using functions:

1. **Reusability**: once some code is written inside a function, it can then be executed 
as many times as you want. This avoids repetition, redundancy and duplicate code. 
The principle is similar to loops, but it works in a bit different way.
2. **Organization**: as programs start to get longer and longer, putting all the code 
inside the main function becomes increasingly hard to manage: with functions we can 
split our programs into small, modular chunks that are easier to organize, test, use and 
reuse.

## Where to put them

Functions need to be written ***before*** they are used with an invocation. Therefore, they 
usually stay at the top of the program, before `main()` and after all the *includes* and 
*namespaces*.

Remember that since `main()` is also a function, every other function has to be written 
**outside** of it, because unlike some other programming languages **C/C++ does not support 
nested functions** (functions inside functions).

## Parts of a function

A function is made up of a signature 

To understand how a function is created let's see the generic form:

```cpp
// do not compile this!
returnType functionName(type parameter1, type parameter2, ...) {
	instructions;
	return ...;
}
```

For example, a simple function that returns the sum of two variables can be written like this:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
	int sum = a+b;
	return sum;
}
```

:::note

Of course, this is not a useful function, but at least it's simple to understand and 
it will help you to grasp the concept of how a function works more easily way through the 
following explanations.

### Analysis

Now let's analyze every part that makes up a function like the one above:

![Parts of a function](../assets/function-parts.svg)
<figcaption>Fig.2. The various components of a function.</figcaption>

- **Return type**: this is the primitive type of the output value that the function will 
return.
- **Function name**: as variables, also functions require a name in order to be 
declared. This name is an identifier and it's also called *header*. It will be used 
every time we'll need to call (refer to) that function, and it identifies it uniquely.
- **Parameters**: they are local variables that take *arguments* (values of other 
variables from outside) in input when the function is called. You work with them inside 
the body of a function. Parameters can be one, more than one but also zero. In the latter 
case, we can put the keyword `void` inside the parentheses or simply open and close a pair of 
round parentheses (most recommended) like in `main()`. It's important to remember that you always 
have to specify the type of *each* of the ***formal parameters*** (this is how they are called) 
inside a function, but not when you call it (see [function call](#function-call-invocation)).
- **Header**: it's the whole first line of a function and it encloses all the three components 
mentioned above: *return type*, *name* and *parameters*.
- **Body**: it's the block of statements required to perform a specific task for which 
that function is built. The instructions are always enclosed in the function's curly 
brackets `{...}`.
- **Return**: the `return` instruction always terminates the execution of a function, so 
it must be typed at the end. It can be only 1 for each function, and it's used to *return* 
(provide/give back in output, but *<u>not</u>* as a text on the console like with `cout`!) 
the result of the computation performed in the function itself. What follows the *return* 
keyword (it can be a value like `0`, a variable like `sum` or an expression like `a+b`) is 
what the function gives in output when invocated and executed, and this needs to be stored 
somewhere if the function is not of type `void` (see *procedures* for further explanation). 
We have already used `return` in the `main()` function.

:::info Difference (Parameter ðŸ†š Argument)

When a function is called, the *actual* values that are passed during the call are called 
**arguments**. So the arguments are the data you externally pass into the function's 
parameters.

The values which are defined at the time of the function prototype or definition 
of the function are called **parameters**, more precisely *formal parameters*. Formal 
parameters are local variables to which the values of the arguments are are assigned 
when the function is called[^1].

We dig deeper into this difference and learn why it's fundamental in 
[this lesson](https://c-cpp-notes.vercel.app/docs/cpp/passage-of-values).

:::

:::note Terminology

At the top I said that the first line of a function is called "header". If you remember, 
though, "*[header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/header-files-in-c-cpp-and-its-uses/)*"
is also the term used with the *header files* that are included in a program when we 
write the *preprocessor directive* `#include <...>`, and it's a file that contains a set 
of predefined standard library functions.

Therefore, even if among C/C++ developers the first line of a function is often called 
"header", this is actually a wrong term for the aforementioned reason. A better one could 
be *signature*, but the best are ***function declaration*** and ***prototype*** (this last 
term, though, is used in a different case that we will cover later in another lesson). 
See this [Stack Overflow Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43177284/c-terminology-header-vs-signature)
for more info.

## Function types

Before creating a function, we need to know about the two types that exist in C++:

**1.** Classic functions <br/>
**2.** Procedures

They can both (optionally) take inputs, but for the outputs the situation is different.

### Classic functions

Classic functions are just like the one we saw earlier:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
	int sum = a+b;
	return sum;
}
```

They always start with the return type (any primitive type: `int`, `bool`, `float`â€¦) and 
when they are invoked they return a value that has to be stored somewhere, like a variable, 
to work with it.

### Procedures

A procedure is a particular type of function that performs a task but **does not produce 
information** as outputs. In other words, they cannot return any numeric value, but 
they can, for example, print some text on the screen or make calculations.
```cpp
void add(int a, int b) {
	int sum = a+b;
	cout << "The sum is: " << sum << endl;
	return; // this line is optional
}
```

Notice the `void` type keyword. It means no return value. If you write `return 5` inside 
a procedure, the compiler will throw out an error.


## Function call (invocation)

Invoking a function means telling the compiler to execute that function. The CPU do 
that and then, when the function ends, it returns to the place where it has been invoked to 
resume execution. You put the function call whenever you need it, but needless to say, you 
can also never invoke it.

Before invoking a function, we need to know its type.

If it's a **classic function**, the invocation is made by storing the return value of that 
function inside a variable:

:::caution

I inverted the main function and user-defined functions for clarity reasons. If you want to use 
the function correctly in a program you'll have to put it before the main function. There's 
actually another method called "*forward declaration*" to avoid this and put functions at the 
end of the program, but I'll cover it in a separate lesson.

:::

```cpp {3}
// inside main function
int x=5, y=2;
int result = add(x,y) // output: 7

// classic function (outside main)
int add(int a, int b) { // a and b becomes 5 and 2
	int sum = a+b;
	return sum;
}
```

If it's a **procedure**, instead, we don't need to store any value, so it's simply:

```cpp {3}
// inside main function
int x=5, y=2;
add(x,y) // output: 7

// procedure (outside main)
void add(int a, int b) { // a and b becomes 5 and 2
	cout << a+b << endl;
	return;
}
```

You can learn more about the differences by reading this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-function-and-procedure/) 
by GeeksForGeeks.

:::note Which is better?

Which method is better between classic function and procedure? Well, there is no hard and 
strict rule on which method should be chosen. Technically they are both true.

You have to choose a particular method depending upon the situation and how you want to solve 
a problem.

:::

Note that in neither of these cases a type has been specified inside the function call 
(`add(x,y)`) for a parameter passed. You don't have to do that because **the type is already 
specified in the header of the function**.

### Passage of values

In both cases, `x` and `y` values are passed and copied inside `a` and `b` respectively. They 
are different variable pairs, but with the function call `sum(x,y)` they have associated and 
matched with each other in that order. I could have called them both `a` and `b` with any `x` 
or `y` identifier, but I intentionally made that to briefly explain how the passage of values 
works.

Since this is a tricky topic to explain and understand, but also very important, the next chapter 
is dedicated exactly to that.
