In C and C++ there are two ways to pass some data to a function: *by value* and *by 
reference*.

Both of them are strictly related to the *actual parameters* (or arguments) and *formal 
parameters*, though, so it's better to understand and distinguish them before going forward.


## Parameter types

In support of the following explanation I'm going to use an example of a program that prompts 
the user to enter the base and height of a rectangle and with a function calculates the area 
of the quadrilateral (according to the formula **a = b*h**), storing that value in the 
variable `a`:

```cpp {4-7,17} title="area-of-rectangle.cpp"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

float area(float b, float h) {
	float area = b*h;
	return area;
}

int main() {
	float base, height;
	
	cout << "enter the base: " << endl;
	cin >> base;
	cout << "enter the height: " << endl;
	cin >> height;
	
	float a = area(base, height);
	cout << "the area is: " << a << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

:::note

This code works directly, so I highly encourage you to try it. As always, feel free to run 
this program yourself and experiment with it as much as you want.

### Code explanation

#### Function

Before the main function, at line **4**, the function area is defined. Here we multiply the 
formal parameters `b` and `h` and store the result in a new variable called `area`. Then we 
return it. 

#### Main

In the main function we create two new variables, `base` and `height`, and we ask to the user 
to insert the values that we'll then assign to each variable.

In line **17** we create another variable, `a`, and here we call the function previously 
created passing as arguments `base` and `height` (not `b` and `h`!), without specifying any 
type. When the compiler compiles the function that has just been called, it calculates a value 
`area` and then returns it. We store that value in `a`.

The `float` type of the variables and the function have been used to cover the cases when 
inputs have decimal digits, but other types like `int` or `double` can be used too.

#### Return (in details)

Inside the function `area()`, the `return area;` instruction finalizes the function and 
returns the control back to the function that called it in the first place (so `main()` 
in our example).

At this moment the program follows its regular course from the same point at which it was 
interrupted by the call to `area()`. But additionally, because the return statement in our
function `area()` specified a value, this value becomes the value of the function call.

The variable `a` will be set to the value returned by the multiplication performed inside 
`area(float b, float h)`, that is `b*h`. 
To explain it another way, you can imagine that the function call `area()` 
is literally replaced by the value it returns, and then this value is stored in a variable.

Just as shown in this figure:

![Returned value](../assets/function-return-value.svg)
<figcaption>Fig.1. How the returned value of a function is stored.</figcaption>

In this general example, a `fName()` function is invoked, and when it's executed its result 
replaces the invocation `fName(x, y)` and gets stored in a variable `var`. **`val` = `returned 
value`**.
The intermediate step (where `fName(x, y)` becomes the returned value) is not shown for 
simplicity.

:::info Remember

All this process happens when we use classic functions. For procedures (functions with `void` 
type), instead, all this doesn't subsist (it's not true) because procedures *never* have a 
return value.

:::

### Actual parameter (argument)

The actual parameters, or arguments, are the actual values (or values of variables) that get 
**passed** to a function. In our previous example, we invoke the function `area()` that has two 
parameters, `b` and `h`, and we pass those arguments as `base` and `height`. We could have 
passed also some values directly, like 3 and 4, as arguments. Try yourself with our example 
program.

This scheme will probably convey better how these two different types of parameters are used:

![Passing values scheme](../assets/function-passing-values.svg)
<figcaption>Fig.2. How arguments are passed to a function (example).</figcaption>

### Formal parameter

The formal parameters are the local variables of the function that **receive** the arguments.
In our example, they are `b` and `h` and they receive the values specified during the 
invocation, which are `base` and `height`.

### General scheme

<figcaption>Fig.3. How arguments are passed to a function (in general).</figcaption>


## Passing by value ðŸ†š by reference

Let's now take another program. Imagine you want to write a function of type `void` that 
swaps two variables (the algorithm for swapping is explained in a 
[previous lesson](https://c-cpp-notes.vercel.app/docs/cpp/swapping)) called `a` and `b`:

```cpp {4-8,16} title="swapping.cpp"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void swap(int x, int y) {
	int temp = x;
	x = y;
	y = temp;
}

int main() {
	int a=2, b=5;
	
	cout << a << endl;
	cout << b << endl;
	
	swap(a, b);
	
	cout << a << endl;
	cout << b << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

Inside main we call the function `swap()` passing `a` and `b` as arguments (actual parameters).
In the function at line **4** we receive those arguments and inside the body we swap them.
Remember that it's of type `void`, so it's a special function that does not have a return value.
Swapping is made by creating a new variable `temp` (following the algorithm already explained 
in a previous tutorial), and after all the instructions we don't need to return anything.

#### Troubleshooting

Now try to run this program. What will be the output?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
	<div class="output">
		<code class="output">
			2<br/>
			5<br/>
			2<br/>
			5<br/>
		</code>
	</div>
</details>

It turns out that **the values 2 and 5 haven't swapped**!

But why?

### Pass by value (or copy)

#### Local scope

If you remember, in the previous chapter I mentioned that functions have formal parameters, 
which are basically variables that have **local scope**. Actually, the whole body of a function 
with all the code inside it is also the local scope of the function itself. This means that 
they all have a lifetime and visibility *limited* only to that function and you can't access them 
outside of the function body (it's the same principle applied to code blocks, where variables 
inside of these blocks are not global).

For instance, in our program you can't use the `temp` variable (created inside the function) 
in the main scope, because the scope of local variables is limited to the same block level 
in which they are declared.

When we invoke a function (as we have done so far), the arguments that we pass to the function 
are passed *by value*, or *by copy*. These terms come from the fact that **the values of the 
actual parameters written in the function call are** ***copied*** **inside the formal 
parameters**, and then the function works on those copies ***locally***.

In our code example, we pass `a` and `b`, 2 and 5 respectively, so `x` and `y` in the 
function assume those two values, but they are different variables with **different locations 
in memory**.

For each variable, we are just passing copies of its value and not the variable itself. 
Therefore, when passing by value, as long as the formal parameters have not been declared 
as constant, changes that we apply to them (e.g. swapping) will only be performed within the 
function scope; nothing will happen outside of it, for example in main. 

In short, with pass-by-value if we change the parameters **we lose all the modifications 
outside of the function**.

![Swapping by value](../assets/swap-value.svg)
<figcaption>Fig.4. Pass by value (or copy). The swapping doesn't happen in main.</figcaption>

That's why with our actual program we get this output:
<div class="output">
<code class="output">
	2<br/>
	5<br/>
	2<br/>
	5<br/>
</code>
</div>

### Pass by reference

To solve this problem we can pass arguments *by reference*. When we call and pass by reference, 
actual and formal parameters refer to the **same memory location**, so when changes are made 
to the formal parameters, also actual parameters will change. In this way we associate these 
two types of parameters as a singular entity.

In practice, the *invoked* function and the *invoking* function have the same parameters and 
the eventual changes get reflected on both sides.

There are two ways to do this.

To pass by reference is by prefixing each formal parameter with an ampersand symbol **`&`** in 
the signature of the function.

In our case the solution will be:
```cpp {1}
void swap(int &x, int &y) {
	int temp = x;
	x = y;
	y = temp;
}
```

Sometimes, you may see function parameters written in this way too: `void swap(int& x, int& y)`. 
Here the `&` symbol is put immediately after thy type of each parameter (`int`) and after that, 
there's a space. Both writings are completely equivalent (just like with pointers[^1]), so use 
the one you prefer.

![Swapping by reference](../assets/swap-reference.svg)
<figcaption>Fig.5. Pass by reference. The swapping is successful!</figcaption>

### Pass by address (or pointer)

There's also another method, which similarly implies the ampersand symbol, but in another 
way. It's used in conjunction with *pointers*, which are special variables that are capable of 
containing memory addresses of some other variables. To declare a pointer parameter, we write 
the asterisk symbol **`*`** followed by the identifier inside the function's round brackets.

When we write:

 ```cpp {1,7}
void swap(int *x, int *y) {
	int temp = *x;
	*x = *y;
	*y = temp;
}
// inside main
swap(&a, &b);
```

`*x` and `*y` will store not the values but copies of the **addresses** of `a` and `b` (arguments) 
into the formal parameters. Then, the function uses the addresses to access the arguments/actual 
parameters. When you call the function you have to put the `&` symbol before the names of the 
arguments, which indicates the respective address. Call by address is basically call by reference, 
except that a copy *of the reference/address* is passed to the function.

Then, inside the function, `*x = *y` and `*y = temp` lines mean that the compiler has to change 
the original values (the content stored) of the addresses of `x` and `y` variables, so the 
changes will remain effective even outside of the function. The act of accessing the value from 
a certain memory location through the pointer against which it's pointing is called *dereferencing*.

:::note Which one to use?

I honestly prefer passing by reference simply because it's easier, but it's not 
necessarily the best. You can find more details on how these last two methods work in 
[this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/passing-by-pointer-vs-passing-by-reference-in-c/) 
by GeeksforGeeks.

:::

Both pass-by-reference and pass-by-address methods will give us the correct output:

<div class="output">
<code class="output">
	2<br/>
	5<br/>
	5<br/>
	2<br/>
</code>
</div>

#### Performances

Pass-by-reference is more efficient than pass-by-value because it does not copy the 
arguments. The formal parameter is an alias for the argument. When the called function 
reads or writes the formal parameter, it is actually reading or writing the argument itself[^2], 
not a copy of it.

### Structured data types

We said that when we pass an argument by value, the function parameter receives a copy of that 
argument. For fundamental types, making a copy of the argument into the function parameter is 
cheap, so this is fine to do. However, copying is typically costly and relatively slow for 
structured (*non-primitive*) data types (like arrays, `string` objects, structs and others), so 
it's generally discouraged to do for efficiency reasons. We can avoid making an expensive copy 
by passing **by reference** instead, even if you aren't going to change the parameter(s).

:::note

Non-primitive types can still be passed by value in C and C++: if you try to do this, the 
compiler will use a special function called the copy constructor (or in some cases in C++11, 
the move constructor) to initialize the parameter as a copy of the argument[^3].
