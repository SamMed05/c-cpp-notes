Now that you know the theory, it's time for some practice!

In this section you'll find a collection of exercises on what we have done so far (the basics of programming with C++). For each exercise one or multiple solutions are provided, but try to make the program yourself first. Sometimes there will be and hint to help you if you are struggling.

For simplicity, we will (almost always) assume for these exercises that the input of the user is valid. If you want to handle the case of invalid inputs, you may want to use a do-while loop.

A difficulty is assigned to each exercise using a 3-star rating. The difficulty is calibrated for beginners. Keep in mind that it is a subjective parameter, therefore may not be accurate. 


### Compare two numbers (â˜…â˜†â˜†)

import compare_two_numbers from '!!raw-loader!./code-snippets/compare-two-numbers.cpp';
import compare_two_numbers_2 from '!!raw-loader!./code-snippets/compare-two-numbers-2.cpp';

Compare two numbers entered by the user and print which one is bigger and lower.

### Triangle categorizer (â˜…â˜…â˜†)

import triangle_categorizer from '!!raw-loader!./code-snippets/triangle-categorizer.cpp';

Write a program to check if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene given the 3 sides.

Note:
- An *equilateral* triangle has all three sides the same length
- An *isosceles* triangle has exactly two sides of the same length
- A *scalene* triangle has all sides of different lengths

Remember: any side of a triangle must be shorter than the other two sides added together. If a side is equal to the other two sides or greater, the triangle is not valid.

Criteria for a valid triangle:

1. a + b > c
2. a + c > b
3. b + c > a

1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5

A pendulum oscillates with a period *p* expressed in seconds which is a function of the length *l* in meters of the suspension thread according to the following formula: $p = 2 * \pi * \sqrt{l/g}$ where the constant *g* is the acceleration of gravity, which on Earth is 9.81 m/s^2. Write a C++ program that determines the oscillation period of the pendulum, given its length *l* in centimeters.
