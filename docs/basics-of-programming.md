# Basics of programming

A program is made with a sequence of certain phases. The process can vary a lot, but generally it follow this process:
1. Analysis of the problem
2. Design/planning
3. Programming
4. Testing
5. Validation

This sequence of steps leads the developer to create a functional program that can automate a task. 

In the testing phese the developer checks if what has been done is working as expected, and if not it start again by thinking and designing a new potential solution.

## Definitions

An *algoritm* is a sequence of multiple consecutive instructions written in a determinated language to solve a problem and obtain a certain output.
Even if you don't notice it, when you are following a cooking recipe or an instruction booklet you are executing an algorithm.

A *program* is a set of data and algorithms to manipulate that data.

A *programming language* is the language with which we can communicate with a computer and provide it with instructions to execute.
Computers understand only one language, the **machine code** or **binary code**, which is considered a *low-level programming language* because it's closer to how the machine works.

A programmer, instead, in his/her every day life will probably use a *high-level programming language* like C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript and many others because they are easier to understand, more abstract and closer to the human thinking and language.

## Effectiveness ðŸ†š Efficiency

When creating a program, an output can often be obtained by a lot of different ways. 
Although (if done well) all programs returns the same output, each one has a different way of approaching the problem and working out the solution.

In this situation, every program is *effective* because the desired output is obtained.
The efficiency, though, is different because the amount of resources used to execute and obtain the output varies from program to program.

Of course, the less resources we use the better, so that we can say that our program is *efficient*, in addition to being effective.

## General recommendations

While programming (or coding) in general, it's important to keep in mind some relevant advices, principles and best practices:

- Be very fussy and meticulous
- Use meaningful names for variables
- Code as if another person will have to read it tomorrow, without being in your mind
- Keep the code well commented
- Complicated is different from complex, and it's better to avoid the first one: Keep It Simple
- Give the right importance to indentation
- Think in advance about reusability of the code you are writing now.

Following these steps, along with practice and a strong (strong!) motivation, will trasform you in a good and proud programmer.
